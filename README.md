This Terraform deploys an sshd bastion service on AWS:
===================================

# Overview

This plan provides socket-activated sshd-containers with one container instantiated per connection and destroyed on connection termination or else after 12 hours- to deter things like reverse tunnels etc. The host assumes an IAM role, inherited by the containers, allowing it to query IAM users and request their ssh public keys lodged with AWS. The actual call for public keys is made with a GO binary, downloaded from S3 to the host at deploy time and made available via shared volume in the docker image. In use the Docker container queries AWS for users with ssh keys at runtime, creates local linux user accounts for them and handles their login. When the connection is closed the container exits. This means that users log in _as themselves_ and manage their own ssh keys using the AWS web console or CLI. For any given session they will arrive in a vanilla Ubuntu container with passwordless sudo and can install whatever applications and frameworks might be required for that session. Because the IAM identity checking and user account population is done at container run time and the containers are called on demand, there is no delay between creating an account with a public ssh key on AWS and being able to access the bastion. If users have more than one ssh public key then their account will be set up so that any of them may be used- AWS allows up to 5 keys per user. 

This plan creates a dns entry for the host of the format

  	name = "${var.environment_name}-${data.aws_region.current.name}-bastion-service.${var.dns_domain}"

e.g.

	dev-eu-west-1-bastion-service.yourdomain.com
	
this ensures a consistent and obvious naming format for each combination of AWS account and region.

The container shell prompt is set similarly but with a systemd incremented counter, e.g. for 'aws_user'

    aws_user@dev-eu-west-1_1-172:~$ 

and a subsequent container would have

    aws_user@dev-eu-west-1_2-172:~$ 

etc. Sadly the -172 (digits will vary) part is an artefact of systemd unit templating that appears difficult to avoid.

**The host is set to run the latest patch release at deployment of Debian Stretch**. Debian was chosen because the socket activation requires systemd but Ubuntu 16.04 does not automatically set up dhcp for additional elastic network interfaces. **The login username is 'admin'**. The host sshd is available on port 2222 and uses standard ec2 ssh keying. If you do not whitelist any access to this port directly from the outside world (plan default) then it may be convenient to access from a container, e.g. with 

    sudo apt install -y curl; ssh -p2222 admin@`curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4`

## Subnets

`subnet_master` is required but any number of additional subnets may be specified as a list under `subnet_additional`. For each additional subnet an additional elastic network interface (NIC) is created, connected to this subnet with the bastion_service_host policy applied.

# In Use

## IAM user names and Linux user names

*with thanks to [michaelwittig](https://github.com/widdix/aws-ec2-ssh)*

IAM user names may be up to 64 characters long.

Linux user names may only be up to 32 characters long.

Allowed characters for IAM user names are:
> alphanumeric, including the following common characters: plus (+), equal (=), comma (,), period (.), at (@), underscore (_), and hyphen (-).

Allowed characters for Linux user names are (POSIX ("Portable Operating System Interface for Unix") standard (IEEE Standard 1003.1 2008)):
> alphanumeric, including the following common characters: period (.), underscore (_), and hyphen (-).

Therefore, characters that are allowed in IAM user names but not in Linux user names:
> plus (+), equal (=), comma (,), at (@).

This solution will use the following mapping for those special characters in iam usernames when creating linux user accounts on the sshd_worker container:

* `+` => `plus`
* `=` => `equal`
* `,` => `comma`
* `@` => `at`

So for example if we have an iam user called `test+=,@test` (which uses all of the disputed characters)

this username would translate to `testplusequalcommaattest` and they would need to shell in, e.g. with 

`ssh testplusequalcommaattest@dev-eu-west-1-bastion-service.yourdomain.com`

## Users should be aware that:

* They are logging on _as themselves_ using their AWS IAM identity
* They must manage their own ssh keys using the AWS interface(s), e.g. in the web console under **IAM/Users/Security credentials** and 'Upload SSH public key'.
* The ssh server key is set at container build time. This means that it will change whenever the bastion host is respawned

The following is referenced in "message of the day" on the container: 

* They have an Ubuntu userland with passwordless sudo within the container, so they can install whatever they find useful for that session
* Every connection is given a newly instanced container, nothing persists to subsequent connections. Even if they make a second connection to the service from the same machine at the same time it will be a seperate container.
* When they close their connection that container terminates and is removed
* If they leave their connection open then the host will kill the container after 12 hours

## Logging

The sshd-worker container is launched with `v /dev/log:/dev/log` This causes logging information to be recorded in the host systemd journal which is not directly accesible from the container. It is thus simple to see who logged in and when by interrogating the host, e.g.

	journalctl | grep 'Accepted publickey'

gives information such as

	April 27 14:05:02 dev-eu-west-1-bastion-host sshd[7294]: Accepted publickey for aws_user from UNKNOWN port 65535 ssh2: RSA SHA256:*****************************

## Note that:

* ssh keys are called only at login- if an account or ssh public key is deleted from AWS whilst a user is logged in then that session will continue until otherwise terminated.
* At present logging is confined to the host machine- if it is respawned then so are the logs

# Notes for deployment

* **Currently the s3 bucket creation and go binary upload is done manually** Bear in mind that S3 bucket names must be *DNS globally unique*, i.e. for *all* users *everywhere* so we cannot neccesarily rely on automatically creating a bucket given with a given name as it may altready be taken.

* This plan contains a submodule to create the IAM 'bastion_service' role and attached policies. If you are deploying to a new AWS account then you need to include this module. If you have already deployed to an AWS account but simply want to set up another bastion service host, e.g. in a different region, then you should comment out the module call near the top of 'main.tf'. If you do not then  be aware that when deploying to multiple regions within a single AWS account this plan will report 'failures' similar to the below. These are harmless but because IAM policies and roles span regions, this terraform plan 'as-is' tries to provision all resources in each region and generates failures if trying to create 'new' resources that already exist, e.g. as below. Unfortunately as at March 2018 It is not possible to use 'count' on Terraform *modules* and booleans are not otherwise supported.

## Components

**EC2 Host OS (debian) with:**

* awscli (for grabbing go binary)
* Systemd docker unit
* Systemd service template unit
* IAM Profile connected to EC2 host

**IAM Role module**

* IAM role
* IAM policies
* IAM instance profile

**Docker container** 'sshd_worker' - built at host launch time using generic ubuntu image, we add sshd and sudo.

**[Go binary](https://github.com/Fullscreen/iam-authorized-keys-command)**  manually made available in S3 for download to host- **be sure to make access read only to prevent people trojanning it!** For peace of mind the [upstream repo has been forked to a companion repo](https://github.com/joshuamkite/iam-authorized-keys-command).

The files in question on the host deploy thus:

	/opt
	├── iam_helper
	│   ├── iam-authorized-keys-command
	│   └── ssh_populate.sh
	└── sshd_worker
	    └── Dockerfile

* `iam-helper` is made available as a read-only volume to the docker container as /opt.
* `iam-authorized-keys-command` is the Go binary that gets the users and ssh public keys from aws
* `ssh_populate.sh` is the container entry point and populates the local user accounts using the go binary
* `sshd_worker/Dockerfile` is obviously the docker build configuration. It uses a static release of Ubuntu (16.04 in dev) from the public Docker registry.
